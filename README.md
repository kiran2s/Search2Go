# Search2Go

Search2Go is an Android app that allows you to take a picture of any text (e.g. printed document, computer screen, billboard, 
whiteboard etc...) and perform searches on that text (currently supports searching in Google and Youtube) quickly and accurately.

Search2Go also provides an Advanced Search feature that allows you to split detected text line-by-line or by word-by-word and use 
drag-and-drop to craft search queries. Manual alterations can also be made to your query as necessary.
