# Search2Go

Search2Go is an Android app that allows you to take a picture of any text (e.g. printed document, computer screen, billboard, 
whiteboard etc...) and perform searches on that text (currently supports searching in Google and Youtube) quickly and accurately.

Search2Go also provides an Advanced Search feature that allows you to split detected text by line or by word to craft search queries
and make manual alterations to your query as necessary.
